## Welcome
Hello! Below is a showcase of some of the projects I have worked on. This is not an exhaustive list as not everything I've done can be put on Github. For more information on any of the projects, check out its associated repo by clicking on the project name!



## ðŸ§ª Data Science and Machine Learning
| Project | Tools | Description
|--|--|--|
|[Skills Clustering and Curriculum Design](https://github.com/WFERRIE/CurriculumDesign)|Python, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, spaCy, Beautiful Soup|Project for a Data Science course as part of my Master's, the goal of this project was to design a hypothetical curriculum for a Data Science and Machine Learning masters program based on analysis of current job market. This was accomplished by scraping online job postings and using NLP to extract relevant features. Then, hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and other analyses were performed to better organize skill requirements into a cohesive curriculum. |
|[Computer Vision for Fracture Detection](https://github.com/WFERRIE/FractureDetection/)|Python, YOLOv8|Created a deep learning computer vision model for detecting fractures and depth-markers in drill core samples via fine-tuning of a YOLOv8 model.|
|[$MSFT Daily Returns Prediction](https://github.com/WFERRIE/MSFT-Final-Project)|Python, scikit-learn, Seaborn, TA-Lib| Final project for an AI in Finance course, the goal of this proejct was to create a model to predict the daily returns on $MSFT using other stock market data and technical indicators. This is an end-to-end machine learning project, including exploratory data analysis, pipeline creation, feature selection, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and final model evaluation.|
|[C++ Machine Learning Library](https://github.com/WFERRIE/ml_cpp)|C++, NumCpp| This is a personal project in which I am creating my own machine learning library in C++. This is in an effort to improve my C++ skills, and better understand the underlying math behind different ML models and algorithms. |
| [SQL Business Case Studies](https://github.com/WFERRIE/8-Week-SQL) |PostgreSQL | My solutions to the [8-Week-SQL-Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/): a series of eight different business case studies, demonstrating my ability to perform complex SQL queries and drive impact within a business.|

## ðŸ¤– Robotics
| Project | Tools | Description
|--|--|--|
| [Maze Delivery Robot](https://github.com/WFERRIE/MazeRover) |  C++, MATLAB, Arduino | Designed, prototyped, built, and programmed a robot capable of driving around a maze with obstacle avoidance, localizing itself within the maze, finding and picking up a block, and delivering the block to a drop-off zone. |
| [Robot Card Dealer](https://github.com/WFERRIE/RobotCardDealer) | C++, Arduino | Designed, prototyped, built, and programmed a robot that can deal a variable number of cards to a variable number of players. |


## âœ¨ Personal Projects
| Project | Tools | Description
|--|--|--|
| [Inventory Management System](https://github.com/WFERRIE/InventoryManagementSystem) | Python, Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap, SQLite | A simple webapp to keep track of inventory with CRUD functionality. |
| [Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer](https://github.com/WFERRIE/PathfindingAlgorithmVisualizer) |C++, raylib | A program to interactively visualize pathfinding algorithms, with ability to set start, end, and locked nodes. |
