## Welcome
Hi there! Below is a showcase of some of the projects I have worked on. Some of these were for school assignments, so I've gone ahead and redacted some of the code just in case those assignments are still being used.


## ðŸ§ª Machine Learning / Data Science

## ðŸ¤– Mechatronics
These projects were done in the final year of my undergrad. They were pretty challenging, and I lost a lot of sleep working on them, but I learned a ton, and they were a very rewarding experience. 

### [Pathfinding Robot (2021)](https://github.com/WFERRIE/MazeRover)
As part of a mechatronics class, myself and three friends created a robot capable of navigating a maze. More specifically, the robot had to:

 1. Drive around the maze and localize itself within it
 2. Once localized, drive to a predetermined 'pickup' location
 3. At the pickup location, detect and pick up a block
 4. Drive the block to a 'dropoff' zone, and drop it off

The robot had to be built totally from scratch, and we were graded on its performance across three milestones over the course of three weeks. While all four of us contributed to all aspects of the rover, we each had different primary responsibilities, mine being the MATLAB code that controlled the rover inside of the maze, and sent commands to the onboard microcontrollers.

### [Robot Card Dealer (2022)](https://github.com/WFERRIE/RobotCardDealer)
As part of a microcontrollers class, we had to use microcontrollers to perform some sort of task. Three friends and I thought it'd be fun to create a robot that dealt cards. We originally planned for it to also play Blackjack (serving as the dealer), but after we accidently fried our Arduino Mega, we had to use two Arduino Unos. Unfortunately, with our new architecture Blackjack just wasn't feasible within our time constraints. However the robot was still able to deal a variable number of cards to a variable number of players, and we ended up with a great final grade!

## âœ¨ Personal Projects
This is a list of a few projects I have done either for fun or just for the sake of learning.
### [Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer (2020)](https://github.com/WFERRIE/PathfindingAlgorithmVisualizer)
I started this project after coming across [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), a C++ library for making video games. At the time I was learning about pathfinding algorithms, so I thought it'd be fun to make some sort of program to visualize how they work. This was my first time making something in C++ from scratch, so there were a lot of lessons learned, and many things I could've done better. I also only got around to implementing BFS, but it was still a fun project.

### [Inventory Management System (2022)](https://github.com/WFERRIE/InventoryManagementSystem)
This is an old project I did because I was interested in web development - It's a simple webapp to keep track of inventory with CRUD functionality. It uses Bootstrap for frontend, Flask for the backend, and SQLite for the database.
